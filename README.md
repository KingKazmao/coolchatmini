*originally i was going to make a chat application that had it all, It had the ability to Add friends, see who was online and even branch off and make new chats in corrolation witht he current chaos chat, 

*sadly i had to simplify it making it similar to omegele


i used HTML/CSS/ Javascript and socket.io, React

React is something i am very familair with but i did realize i needed to study it a bit more. 
anyway enjoy COOL CHAT MINI
